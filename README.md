## FindDefault: Prediction of Credit Card Fraud
Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions and consumers alike. This project aims to develop a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent. The dataset used contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

Problem Statement
Credit card fraud involves the unauthorized use of a credit card to make purchases or withdraw cash. Detecting such fraud is crucial to prevent customers from being charged for transactions they did not make. The provided dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions making up only 0.172% of all transactions.

Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed and understood the data to identify patterns and trends.
Used descriptive statistics and visualizations to perform data quality checks, handle missing values, and treat outliers.
2. Data Cleaning
Standardized the data.
Addressed missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
3. Dealing with Imbalanced Data
Employed techniques to balance the dataset before model building.
4. Feature Engineering
Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.
5. Model Selection
Selected the most appropriate model based on its performance.
6. Model Training
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained the model using the training set and tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
7. Model Validation
Evaluated the model on unseen data to assess its generalization ability and identify any overfitting issues.
8. Model Deployment
Developed a plan to deploy the trained model in a production environment.
Results and Performance Evaluation
Achieved an accuracy of over 75% on the test dataset.
Implemented hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Conducted comprehensive model validation.
Future Work
Address current model limitations.
Explore alternative algorithms and additional features.
Continuously iterate to enhance model performance and robustness.
Source Code

Conclusion
The developed model shows promise in predicting credit card fraud. However, there is room for improvement. Future work will focus on addressing limitations and further refining the model to better detect fraudulent transactions.
